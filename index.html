<h2 id="learn">Live for free. Work on a long shot.</h2>

<p class="first">The Black Swan Fellowship is a (brief) chance to live for free in a beautiful place, and work on something epic. All basic food, housing, and travel expenses are paid. Location is TBD, but you'll likely be staying on a sailboat, in Rio de Janeiro, in the center of one of the most beautiful landscapes in the world.</p>

<p><strong>There is only one requirement: that you work full-time on something that has a chance&mdash;however small&mdash;of becoming a <em>very</em> big deal.</strong></p>

<p>How you define this is up to you (and of course, us) but it could be an app, a top-40 pop song, a gadget, a style, an activism campaign, a political movement, a religion, a business, a novel, or really any number of things. Even something that would dramatically change <em>your own</em> life counts. It doesn't have to be traditionally altruistic.</p>

<p><strong>Anyone can apply, but applicants under 26 years old and applicants who have attended the <a href="http://www.worcesterma.gov/living-working/public-schools/">Worcester Public Schools</a> will get special consideration.</strong></p>

<p>To apply, email <a href="mailto:blackswanfellows@gmail.com">blackswanfellows@gmail.com</a> with a short description of what you'd like to work on, followed by a list of any work or accomplishments you're especially proud of, with links and background if possible.</p>

<p>Applications are considered on a rolling basis. How long the fellowship lasts is negotiable, but should not be less than two months.</p>
